# Exam-routine-generator-

In universities the semester final exam routine is created based on the credit of the corresponding subject. Suppose, a 3-credit exam is scheduled in a way, that student may get at least 3 days off before the exam.  
This idea is used to develop this exam routine generator.
This is a Java Desktop application. JFrame is used for GUI development. A bruteforce algorithm is used for the routine generation while maintaining the minimum total exam day.
